## Warehouse program

&nbsp;

### Introduction
\
*This is a basic Warehouse program that was created as a part of the Artificial Intelligence Talent Programme. This program is written in C++ and is meant to test our file and data management skills. This program could be optimized and used as a basic product management system.*

*The source code for the program is located at **main.cpp** and the binary file **saveFile.bin** is used to store data used in this program. Use the **main.exe** file to run it and test out the program.*

### Code and program functionality
\
*The program was written based on tasks given in the course. The tasks were divided between two people and are highlighted in the code with comments. At the end of the code, you can see the main function that is used to run the tasks shown before using a simple while() loop and switch() combination so you can try each function. The data was manipulated using the classes and functions that were defined at the start of the code. The data from the file is saved in a vector, which makes it enjoyable to manipulate.*

*Once you run the program, you will get a menu shown on the terminal and it will make you type an **integer** to choose one of the 11 options provided. Once you have written the integer, hit enter and you can test the option you have chosen. We advise you to choose the 1st option as it will provide more context and understanding about the program.*

### Takeaways
\
*This program taught us a lot about memory management and how to handle data in C++. Researching different ways to solve problems, definitely gave us a better understanding of the syntax and different features this language provides.*

*And also, this quote is true:*
